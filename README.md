# Ruby Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes while learning Ruby.
I update everything gradually as I explore the language step by step.

## What’s Inside
- basic syntax notes  
- practice snippets  
- small Ruby experiments  
- simple explanations in my own words  

## Goals
- understand Ruby from the basics  
- build small scripts as practice  
- keep documentation clean and easy to follow  
- track my learning progress over time  

## Topics I’m Exploring
- variables & data types  
- methods & blocks  
- loops & conditionals  
- arrays & hashes  
- classes & modules  
- basic OOP concepts in Ruby  

I’ll continue adding more files as I learn.
